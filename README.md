# Songpick

The intention for this project was to create a simple prototype of pulling in relevant user data from the Spotify API. By learning about a user's musical preferences, the intent was to connect users with other people who also had similar musical interests. These paired up users would then get recommendations from the Songkick API so that they could attend concerts together.

# Visit

Sign-in to Spotify. Type in an artist or choose based on your personal favorites.
Will currently only search for relevant concerts in the NYC area.
